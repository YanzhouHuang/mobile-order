Design Decisions
Why I choose the Android because for me it is easy to test and debug. Also, the IOS system require to connect a mac computer. 
I choose the Android Studio for develop because it is the platform create by google. Android Studio uses the quick growing Gradle build system that is so integrated, and Gradle is really a great tool. 
Also, Android Studio is good for the UI part and the organization.  
Finally, the android studio has the intelligent code editor. An intelligent code editor that helps you each step of the way.
Android Studio is built on IntelliJ and is capable of advanced code completion, refactoring, and code analysis.
